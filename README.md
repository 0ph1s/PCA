🚀 PCA Analysis of Solar System Planets 🌍🌕🪐
This repository contains a Python script that performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Solar System planet data. Using the scikit-learn library, the script standardizes the data, computes the covariance matrix, extracts eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and generates a 3D visualization of the PCA projection.

📌 Features
▸ Data preprocessing and standardization of planetary attributes.
▸ Computation of the covariance matrix and principal component decomposition.
▸ 3D visualization of planets in PCA space with individual labels.

📂 Data
The script uses a CSV file containing planetary information, including ring system presence, global magnetic field, surface pressure, and other key characteristics.

🔧 Technologies
▸ Python
▸ Pandas
▸ NumPy
▸ Scikit-learn
▸ Matplotlib

📊 Visualization
The result is a 3D scatter plot, allowing users to observe how planets are distributed in the transformed PCA space.

🚀 How to Use
▸ Clone the repository
▸ Install dependencies ⟹ pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
▸ Run the script to visualize the PCA analysis
▸ Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute! 🌌✨
